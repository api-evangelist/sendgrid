<!-- API-EVANGELIST-PROVENANCE:BEGIN -->
> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **Not from the company, and here with a question?** You are welcome here — we would rather be the
> front line and point you the right way than have a good report go nowhere. What this repository
> can answer is narrow, though, so it is worth knowing who you are actually looking for:
>
> - **A question about how the API works, an account, billing, or a bug in the service** — that is
>   the company's own support, not us. We profile this API; we do not operate it and cannot see
>   your account.
> - **A bug in an open-source project we only catalog** — file it on that project's own repository.
>   This has happened with a real and correct bug report that reached us instead of the people who
>   could fix it, which helped nobody.
> - **Anything about this listing itself** — the description, the tags, the rating, a missing or
>   wrong artifact — is ours. Open an issue here.
> - **Not sure, or something general about API Evangelist or APIs.io** — open an issue on the
>   [APIs.io Inbox](https://github.com/api-search/inbox) and we will route it.
>
> **This repository contains no software, and we will never ask you to download anything.** There is
> no build, release, installer, or binary here — only text and machine-readable API descriptions, so
> there is nothing here that can be "corrupt" or need "repairing". Any issue, comment, or email
> claiming otherwise and offering a download link is not from us and is hostile. Do not follow the
> link; it is a lure. Report it to GitHub and, if you like, tell us at
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) so we can take it down.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

## APIs

### Twilio SendGrid Account Provisioning API
The Twilio SendGrid Account Provisioning API provides a platform for Twilio SendGrid resellers to manage their customer accounts. This API is for companies that have a formal reseller partnership with Twilio SendGrid.

You can access Twilio SendGrid sub-account functionality without becoming a reseller. If you require sub-account functionality, see the Twilio [SendGrid Subusers](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/subusers) feature, which is available with [Pro and Premier plans](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/).

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_account_provisioning_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Alerts API
The Twilio SendGrid Alerts API allows you to specify an email address to receive notifications regarding your email usage or statistics. You can set up alerts to be sent to a specific email address on a recurring basis, whether for informational purposes or when specific account actions occur.

For most alerts, you can choose to have the alert sent to you as needed, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. The information contained in your alert will be for the last period of the alert. For example, if you choose weekly for the statistics alert, you will receive the statistics for the last week.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_alerts_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid API Keys API
The Twilio SendGrid API Keys API allows you manage your API keys and their settings. Your application, mail client, or website can all use API keys to authenticate access to SendGrid services.

To create your initial SendGrid API Key, you should use the [SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). Once you have created a first key with scopes to manage additional API keys, you can use this API for all other key management.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_api_keys_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Domain Authentication API
The Twilio SendGrid Domain Authentication API allows you to manage your authenticated domains and their settings.

Domain Authentication is a required step when setting up your Twilio SendGrid account because it's essential to ensuring the deliverability of your email. Domain Authentication signals trustworthiness to email inbox providers and your recipients by approving SendGrid to send email on behalf of your domain. For more information, see [**How to Set Up Domain Authentication**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/).

Each user may have a maximum of 3,000 authenticated domains and 3,000 link brandings. This limit is at the user level, meaning each Subuser belonging to a parent account may have its own 3,000 authenticated domains and 3,000 link brandings.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_domain_authentication_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Email Activity API
The Twilio SendGrid Email Activity API allows you to query all of your stored messages, query individual messages, and download a CSV with data about the stored messages. Once retrieved, you can inspect the data associated with your messages to better understand your mail send. For example, you may retrieve all bounced messages or all messages with the same subject line and search for commonalities among them.

You must [purchase additional email activity history](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing/addons/email_activity) to gain access to the Email Activity Feed API.

See **Getting Started with the Email Activity Feed API** for help building queries and working with this API. You can also work with email activity in the **Activity** section of the [Twilio SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity).

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_email_activity_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Email Address Validation API
The Twilio SendGrid Email Address Validation API provides real-time detailed information on the validity of email addresses. You can integrate this validation process into your platform's signup form and customize the best use of email address validation for your use case.

Email Address Validation is available to [Email API Pro and Premier level accounts](https://sendgrid.com/pricing) only. Prior to upgrading your account to Pro or Premier, you will not see the option to create an Email Validation API key. An Email Validation API key is separate from and in addition to your other keys, including Full Access API keys.

You can use this API to:
- Indicate to users that the address they have entered into a form is invalid.
- Drop invalid email addresses from your database.
- Suppress invalid email addresses from your sending to decrease your bounce rate.

See [**Email Address Validation**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/managing-contacts/email-address-validation) for more information.

You can also view your Email Validation results and metrics in the Validation section of the [Twilio SendGrid application user interface](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/managing-contacts/email-address-validation).

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_email_validation_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Enforced TLS API
The Twilio SendGrid Enforced TLS API allows you to specify whether or not the recipient of your mail send is required to support TLS or have a valid certificate.

Twilio SendGrid sends all emails with [Opportunistic TLS](https://sendgrid.com/blog/myth-opportunistic-tls-email-privacy/) by default, meaning email is sent with TLS, and if the recipient's inbox provider does not accept the TLS encryption, we then send the message unencrypted.

You can optionally choose to enforce TLS encryption, meaning that if the recipient's inbox provider does not accept the TLS encryption, Twilio SendGrid drops the message and sends a block event with the message, TLS required but not supported as the description.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_enforced_tls_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Integrations API
Integrations allows you to connect your SendGrid applications with third-party services and forward SendGrid email events to those external applications. Currently, Integrations supports event forwarding to [Segment](https://segment.com/docs). You can use this API to create, delete, view, and update your Integrations.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_integrations_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid IP Access Management API
IP Twilio SendGrid IP Access Management API allows you to control which IP addresses can be used to access your account, either through the SendGrid application user interface or the API.

There is no limit to the number of IP addresses that you can allow.

It is possible to remove your own IP address from your list of allowed addresses, thus blocking your own access to your account. While we are able to restore your access, we do require thorough proof of your identify and ownership of your account. We take the security of your account very seriously and wish to prevent any 'bad actors' from maliciously gaining access to your account. Your current IP is clearly displayed to help prevent you from accidentally removing it from the allowed addresses.

See [**IP Access Management**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/ip-access-management) for more information.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_ip_access_management_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid IP Address Management API
The Twilio SendGrid IP Address Management API combines functionality that was previously split between the Twilio SendGrid [IP Address API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/ip-address) and [IP Pools API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/ip-pools). This functionality includes adding IP addresses to your account, assigning IP addresses to IP Pools and Subusers, among other tasks.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_ip_address_management_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid IP Warmup API
The Twilio SendGrid IP Warm Up API allows you to gradually increasing the volume of mail sent with a dedicated IP address according to a predetermined schedule. This gradual process helps to establish a reputation with ISPs (Internet Service Providers) as a legitimate email sender.

SendGrid can automatically warm up dedicated IP addresses by limiting the amount of mail that can be sent through them per hour. The limit is determined by how long the IP address has been warming up.

See the [warmup schedule](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/warming-up-an-ip-address/#automated-ip-warmup-hourly-send-schedule) to learn how SendGrid limits your email traffic for IPs in warmup.

You can also choose to use Twilio SendGrid's automated IP warmup for any of your IPs from the **IP Addresses** settings menu in the [Twilio SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/ip_addresses).

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_ip_warmup_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid IP Address API
The Twilio SendGrid IP Address API allows you to add and manage dedicated IP addresses and IP Pools for your SendGrid account and Subusers. If you are sending any significant amount of email, SendGrid typically suggests sending from dedicated IPs. It's also best to send marketing and transactional emails from separate IP addresses. In order to do this, you'll need to set up IP Pools, which are groups of dedicated IP addresses you define to send particular types of messages. See the [**Dedicated IP Addresses**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/dedicated-ip-addresses) for more information about obtaining and allocating IPs.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_ips_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Link Branding API
The Twilio SendGrid Link Branding API allows you to configure your domain settings so that all of the click-tracked links, opens, and images in your emails are served from your domain rather than `sendgrid.net`. Spam filters and recipient servers look at the links within emails to determine whether the email appear trustworthy. They use the reputation of the root domain to determine whether the links can be trusted.

You can also manage Link Branding in the **Sender Authentication** section of the Twilio SendGrid application user interface.

 See [**How to Set Up Link Branding**](https: //sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding/) for more information.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_link_branding_v3.yaml)

You can also duplicate and then modify one of the pre-built designs provided by Twilio SendGrid to get you started.

The Designs API provides a REST-like interface for creating new designs, retrieving a list of existing designs, duplicating or updating a design, and deleting a design.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_mc_designs_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Lists API
The Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Lists API allows you to manage your contacts lists programmatically. Lists are static collections of Marketing Campaigns contacts. You can use this API to interact with the list objects themselves. To add contacts to a list, you must use the [Contacts API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/contacts/).

You can also manage your lists using the Contacts menu in the [Marketing Campaigns application user interface](https://mc.sendgrid.com/contacts). For more information about lists and best practices for building them, see [**Building your Contact Lists**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/managing-contacts/building-your-contact-list/).

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_mc_lists_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Segments 2.0 API
The Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Segments V2 API allows you to create, edit, and delete segments as well as retrieve a list of segments or an individual segment by ID.

Segments are similar to contact lists, except they update dynamically over time as information stored about your contacts or the criteria used to define your segments changes. When you segment your audience, you are able to create personalized Automation emails and Single Sends that directly address the wants and needs of your particular audience.

Note that Twilio SendGrid checks for newly added or modified contacts who meet a segment's criteria on an hourly schedule. Only existing contacts who meet a segment's criteria will be included in the segment searches within 15 minutes.

Segments built using engagement data such as "was sent" or "clicked" will take approximately 30 minutes to begin populating.

Segment samples and counts are refreshed approximately once per hour; they do not update immediately. If no contacts are added to or removed from a segment since the last refresh, the sample and UI count displayed will be refreshed at increasing time intervals with a maximum sample and count refresh delay of 24 hours.

You can also manage your Segments with the [Marketing Campaigns application user interface](https://mc.sendgrid.com/contacts). See [**Segmenting Your Contacts**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/managing-contacts/segmenting-your-contacts) for more information.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_mc_senders_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Marketing Campaigns Single Sends API
The Twilio SendGrid Single Sends API allows you to create, manage, and send Single Sends. You can also search Single Sends and retrieve statistics about them to help you maintain, alter, and further develop your campaigns.

A Single Send is a one-time non-automated email message delivered to a list or segment of your audience. A Single Send may be sent immediately or scheduled for future delivery.

Single Sends can serve many use cases, including promotional offers, engagement campaigns, newsletters, announcements, legal notices, or policy updates. You can also create and manage Single Sends in the [Marketing Campaigns application user interface](https://mc.sendgrid.com/single-sends).

The Single Sends API changed on May 6, 2020. See [**Single Sends 2020 Update**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/single-sends-2020-update) for more information.

#### Properties

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_recipients_data_erasure_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Reverse DNS API
The Twilio SendGrid Reverse DNS API (formerly IP Whitelabel) allows you to configure reverse DNS settings for your account. Mailbox providers verify the sender of your emails by performing a reverse DNS lookup.

When setting up Reverse DNS, Twilio SendGrid will provide an A Record (address record) for you to add to the DNS records of your sending domain. The A record maps your sending domain to a dedicated Twilio SendGrid IP address. Once Twilio SendGrid has verified that the appropriate A record for the IP address has been created, the appropriate reverse DNS record for the IP address is generated.

Reverse DNS is available for [dedicated IP addresses](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/dedicated-ip-addresses/) only.

You can also manage your reverse DNS settings in the Sender Authentication setion of the [Twilio SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth).

See [**How to Set Up Reverse DNS**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-reverse-dns/) for more information.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_reverse_dns_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Scheduled Sends API
The Twilio SendGrid Scheduled Sends API allows you to cancel or pause the send of one or more emails using a batch ID.

A `batch_id` groups multiple scheduled mail send requests together with the same ID. You can cancel or pause all of the requests associated with a batch ID up to 10 minutes before the scheduled send time.

See [**Canceling a Scheduled Send**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/stopping-a-scheduled-send) for a guide on creating a `batch_id`, assigning it to a scheduled send, and modifying the send.

See the Mail API's batching operations to validate a `batch_id` and retrieve all scheduled sends as an array.

When a batch is canceled, all messages associated with that batch will stay in your sending queue. When their `send_at` value is reached, they will be discarded.

When a batch is paused, all messages associated with that batch will stay in your sending queue, even after their `send_at` value has passed. This means you can remove a pause status, and your scheduled send will be delivered once the pause is removed. Any messages left with a pause status that are more than 72 hours old will be discarded as Expired.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_scheduled_sends_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Scopes API
The Twilio SendGrid Scopes API allows you to retrieve the scopes or permissions available to a user, see the user's attempts to access your SendGrid account, and, if necessary, deny an access request.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_scopes_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Engagement Quality API
The SendGrid Engagement Quality (SEQ) API allows you to retrieve metrics that define the quality of your email program.

An SEQ score is correlated with:
- The quality of the data in a senders program.
- How wanted the sender's email is by their recipients.

Because wanted email and deliverability are closely related, a higher SEQ metric is correlated with greater deliverability. This means the higher your SEQ score, the more likely you are to land in your recipients' inboxes. See the SEQ Overview page to understand SEQ, how it's calculated, and how you can address your score. The SEQ endpoints allow you to retrieve your scores and scores for your Subusers.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_seq_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Single Sign-On API
The Single Sign-On API allows you to manage your SAML 2.0 SSO configurations. You can also work with your SSO integrations using the SSO section of the [Twilio SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sso).

The Single Sign-On Settings operations allow you to create, retrieve, modify, and delete SSO integrations for your Twilio SendGrid account. Each integration will correspond to a specific IdP such as Okta, Duo, or Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

The Single Sign-On Certificates operations allow you to create, modify, and delete SSO certificates. A SAML certificate allows your IdP and Twilio SendGrid to verify requests are coming from one another using the `public_certificate` and `integration_id` parameters.

The Single Sign-On Teammates operations allow you to add and modify SSO Teammates. SSO Teammates are the individual user accounts who will access your Twilio SendGrid account with SSO credentials. To retrieve or delete an SSO Teammate, you will use the separate [Teammates API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/teammates/).

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_sso_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Statistics API
The Twilio SendGrid Statistics API allows you to retrieve the various statistics related to your email program.

Tracking your emails is an important part of being a good sender and learning about how your users interact with your email. This includes everything from clicks and opens to looking at which browsers and mailbox providers your customers use.

SendGrid has broken up statistics in specific ways so that you can get at-a-glance data, as well as the details of how your email is being used.

Category statistics are available for the previous thirteen months only.

See [**Statistics Overview**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview) for more information.

### Twilio SendGrid Subusers
The Twilio SendGrid Subusers API allows you to create and manage your Subuser accounts. Subusers are available on [Pro and Premier plans](https://sendgrid.com/pricing), and you can think of them as sub-accounts. Each Subuser can have its own sending domains, IP addresses, and reporting. SendGrid recommends creating Subusers for each of the different types of emails you sendone Subuser for transactional emails and another for marketing emails. Independent Software Vendor (ISV) customers may also create Subusers for each of their customers.

You can also manage Subusers in the [Twilio SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers). See [**Subusers**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/subusers) for more information.

#### Properties

### Twilio SendGrid Suppressions API
The Twilio SendGrid Suppressions API allows you to manage your Suppressions or Unsubscribes and Suppression or Unsubscribe groups. With SendGrid, an unsubscribe is the action an email recipient takes when they opt-out of receiving your messages. A suppression is the action you take as a sender to filter or suppress an unsubscribed address from your email send. From the perspective of the recipient, your suppression is the result of their unsubscribe.

You can have global suppressions, which represent addresses that have been unsubscribed from all of your emails. You can also have suppression groups, also known as ASM groups, which represent categories or groups of emails that your recipients can unsubscribe from, rather than unsubscribing from all of your messages.

SendGrid automatically suppresses emails sent to users for a variety of reasons, including blocks, bounces, invalid email addresses, spam reports, and unsubscribes. SendGrid suppresses these messages to help you maintain the best possible sender reputation by attempting to prevent unwanted mail. You may also add addresses to your suppressions.

See [**Suppressions**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/suppressions) for more information.

#### Properties

### Twilio SendGrid Teammates API
The Twilio SendGrid Teammates API allows you to add, manage, and remove Teammates, or user accounts, from your SendGrid account. Teammates function like user accounts on the SendGrid account, allowing you to invite additional users to your account with scoped access. You can think of Teammates as SendGrid's approach to enabling [role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) for your SendGrid account. For even more control over the access to your account, see the [Twilio SendGrid SSO API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/single-sign-on-teammates/), which enables SSO-authenticated Teammates to be managed through a SAML 2.0 identity provider.

#### Properties

### Twilio SendGrid Templates API
The Twilio SendGrid Templates API allows you to create and manage email templates to be delivered with SendGrid's sending APIs. The templates you create will be available using a template ID that is passed to our sending APIs as part of the request. Each template may then have multiple versions associated with it. Whichever version is set as "active" at the time of the request will be sent to your recipients. This system allows you to update a single template's look and feel entirely without modifying your requests to our Mail Send API. For example, you could have a single template for welcome emails. That welcome template could then have a version for each season of the year that's themed appropriately and marked as active during the appropriate season. The template ID passed to our sending APIs never needs to change; you can just modify which version is active.

This API provides operations to create and manage your templates as well as their versions.

Each user can create up to 300 different templates. Templates are specific to accounts and Subusers. Templates created on a parent account will not be accessible from the Subusers' accounts.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_templates_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Tracking Settings API
The Twilio SendGrid Tracking Settings API allows you to configure which tracking settings are enabled for your messages. You can track many of your recipients' interactions with your emails, including which emails they open, which links they click, and when they subscribe to or unsubscribe from your emails. See [**Tracking Settings**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/tracking) for more information.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_tracking_settings_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid User API
The Twilio SendGrid User API allows you to modify the settings of a SendGrid user account such as the user's email address or username. Keeping your user profile up to date helps SendGrid verify who you are and share important communications with you.

See [**Account Details**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/account) for more information. You can also manage your user settings in the [SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/account/details).

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_user_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Verified Senders API
The Twilio SendGrid Verified Senders API allows you to programmatically manage the Sender Identities that are authorized to send email for your account. You can also manage Sender Identities in the [SendGrid application user interface](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth). See [**Single Sender Verification**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/sender-verification/) for more information.

You an use this API to create new Sender Identities, retrieve a list of existing Sender Identities, check the status of a Sender Identity, update a Sender Identity, and delete a Sender Identity.

This API offers additional operations to check for domains known to implement DMARC and resend verification emails to Sender Identities that have yet to complete the verification process.

#### Properties

- [OpenAPI](openapi/tsg_verified_senders_v3.yaml)

### Twilio SendGrid Webhook Configuration API
The Twilio SendGrid Webhooks API allows you to configure the Event and Parse Webhooks.

Email is a data-rich channel, and implementing the Event Webhook will allow you to consume those data in nearly real time. This means you can actively monitor and participate in the health of your email program throughout the send cycle.

The Inbound Parse Webhook processes all incoming email for a domain or subdomain, parses the contents and attachments and then POSTs `multipart/form-data` to a URL that you choose.
